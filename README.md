# Web Engines Hackfest 2015 - MathML in Web Engines

This repository contains the slides of my presentation "MathML in Web Engines"
for the Web Engines Hackfest 2015.

It uses [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/), licensed under the MIT
license. The presentation itself uses various
[free licenses](mathml/LICENSE.md).

The CSS of mathml/index.html also relies on the following font families,
installable from the package manager of most Linux distributions:
* [Latin Modern Math](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/lm-math/download/index_html) for the default font-family of MathML.
* [TeX Gyre Bonum Math](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tg-math/download/index_html#Bonum_Math) for the CSS demo changing the font-family of MathML.
* [Amiri](http://www.amirifont.org/) for the Arabic text used in some demos.
